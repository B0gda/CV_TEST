### About me: I am a student of Samara University and study at the faculty of 02.03.02 (FIIT). I am a very patient person who knows how to get his own way. I am also a very inquisitive person : that is why I additionally began to study the layout of websites and adaptive layout. Then I started developing a credit card website, which I even managed to put up for hosting. And I will continue to study computer technologies, because I still have a lot to learn.

### Skills: C# **(Rider)** ; C++ **(Lion)** ; Js **(including the Node Js library and the WebStorm framework)** .
